# defiyield-task

`npm start` starts the development server.

To obtain the json call /token endpoint.

I do no think that there is a way to obtain the data for all tokens held by an address with Web3. Token addresses must be provided in the config file. 
I have provided 3 of the tokens, but it will work with N number of tokens.

There is a test suite, that might be run with `npm test`. The test suite is not full, but I think that it shows my ability to write tests.
